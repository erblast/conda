# conda
this repository contains conda environments for different platforms that contain python and R and all packages to run oetteR 0.2.8. . They will be updated as they keep being used the goal is to have a set of compatible packages for each platform that can be used from within jupyter notebooks. 

**Note that the packages depend on the custom builds that I made for many R packages and have uploaded to my public anaconda account**
